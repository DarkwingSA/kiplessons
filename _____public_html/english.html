                        The English programme caters for students who are virtual non-readers through to those who have only minor difficulties. The curriculum covers all aspects of English that students are expected to learn in school (where English is the first language). The programme is carefully designed so that each student progresses at his or her own pace. A student can start anywhere within the programme at exactly the level suited to his or her current ability and knowledge.

                        This important programme is designed to assist children who have been identified early as having reading difficulties. It is also targeted at children who have managed to progress through the school system yet lack any real reading capabilities. This programme takes children right back to the basics of reading and is an intensive intervention programme. A FREE assessment is conducted to determine if this programme is appropriate for your child. Depending on age, children can progress from this programme to the Kip McGrath Reading Programme as their reading skills improve.

                        Children who struggle with reading are disadvantaged at school and in life. Reading difficulties are common in children, but with proper attention these difficulties can usually be identified and corrected. The qualified tutors at Kip McGrath understand that reading difficulties are sensitive and potentially embarrassing for children and parents. At our centres, all students are treated with respect and understanding. A positive learning environment makes achievement natural and fun.

                        All children are given a FREE initial assessment to identify areas where learning needs to be concentrated. An individual learning programme is then tailored for your child based on the assessment results. While all centres provide extra lessons for maths, Afrikaans and English, not all centres offer all modules or additional subjects, so please confirm with your local Kip McGrath centre.
