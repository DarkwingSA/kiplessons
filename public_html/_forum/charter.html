<h1>Where does this Forum originate and why does it exist?</h1>

<br>

<p>
This forum grew out of an initiative to find an <strong>effective</strong> way to share the costs of marketing initiatives. i.e. those who pay derive the benefit and there are no <em>"hangers on"</em> who get leads without contributing. The initial solution was to create <strong>KipLessons.co.za</strong> which is a map of each province with the contributing centres listed. In addition, an extensive Google My Business update process was undertaken to ensure that the biggest search engine knows we are ONE GROUP - and improves their ability to include us in search results. An Adwords campaign was also created to ensure we are found when people search for "extra lessons" (and several other keywords). We also started a Facebook ad campaign to reach people who aren't searching (yet). More recently, sponsorship of focused and select expos and conferences has been included.

On this forum we can discuss anything that is relevant to making our business lives easier (and more profitable), but primarily related to:

<ul>
<li>Brand building activities;</li>
<li>KipLessons.co.za website;</li>
<li>Google Adwords; and</li>
<li>Facebook and social media marketing.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Though other matters like the following may also arise :
</p>
<ul>
<li>Discuss issues and possible solutions to problems that we might encounter. (Franchise related or business related)</li>
<li>Brainstorm marketing ideas.</li>
<li>Go to Head Office with suggestions as a forum.</li>
<li>We will have buying power for special deals like furniture, stationery etc.</li>
	
</ul>

<p>
<strong>NB!</strong> If you have any questions or queries, please do not hesitate to contact Paul 082 611 1973
Please remember that by joining this forum, you agree to participate in the entire 2017 budget for social media and other brand building functions, and agree to pay R600 per month for 10 months from beginning Jan - October. This is not a "drop-in" and "drop-out" plan but rather a medium- to long-term strategy that builds our brand, improves search relevance and enhances overall credibility (and brings customers!!).</p>
