<h2> Kip McGrath specialises in English tuition for all primary and secondary levels.
<br>
Give your child the gift of education today.
</h2>

<!-- start of content -->

<p>
The <strong> English </strong>programme caters for students who are virtual non-readers through to
those who have only minor difficulties.
<br>
The curriculum covers all aspects of English that students are expected
to learn in school (where English is the first language). The programme
is carefully designed so that each student progresses at his/her own
pace. A student can start anywhere within the programme at exactly the
level suited to his/her current ability and knowledge.
</p>

<h4>
There are five key areas in the Kip McGrath Education Centre's English curriculum:
<br>
</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Early Reading</li>
  <li>Reading</li>
  <li>Spelling</li>
  <li>Comprehension</li>
  <li>English (Including vocabulary development and grammar) </li>
</ul>

<p>
This important programme is designed to assist children who have been
identified early as having reading difficulties. It is also targeted
towards children who have managed to progress through the school system
yet lack any real reading capabilities. This programme takes children
right back to the basics of reading and is an intensive intervention
programme. A <strong>FREE assessment </strong>is conducted to determine if this
programme is appropriate for your child. Depending on age, children can progress
from this programme to the Kip Reading Programme as their reading
skills improve.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Intensive tutor intervention </li>
  <li>Lessons targeted towards key reading skills </li>
  <li>Booklet based activities and homework sheets </li>
  <li>Computer learning to engage children and accelerate drill </li>
</ul>


<h2>
Reading Programme
</h2>

<p>
Kids who struggle with reading are disadvantaged at school and in life.
Reading difficulties are common in children, but with proper attention
these difficulties can usually be identified and corrected. The
qualified tutors at Kip McGrath understand that reading difficulties
are sensitive and potentially embarrassing for children and parents. At
our centres all students are treated with respect and understanding. A
positive learning environment makes achievement natural and fun.

All children are given a <strong> FREE initial assessment</strong> to identify areas
where learning needs to be concentrated. An individual learning programme is then tailored for your child, based on the assessment results. While all Centres provide extra lessons for Maths, Afrikaans and English, <strong>not all Centres offer all modules or additional subjects</strong> so please confirm with your local Kip McGrath what they offer.
