children's education</h2>

<!-- start of content -->
<div style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial;">
<p>The first Kip McGrath Education Centre opened its doors in
Newcastle NSW 40 years ago with the founding principle, <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">"any child
can learn if they are taught properly"</span>. Founded by school
tutors Kip and Dug McGrath, that first tutoring centre has grown since
then into a global franchise network of over 500 tutoring centres owned
and operated by qualified and experienced tutors, with a common
motivation; a passion for teaching.</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(0, 84, 159);">Our Philosophy:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>We know that unresolved gaps in foundational learning can
have lifelong impacts on your child.</li>
  <li>We believe in building confidence, self-esteem and
providing results for your child.</li>
  <li>We believe that all children can succeed if given the right
support.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>We think learning can be fun!</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: center; color: rgb(0, 84, 159);">"<span
 style="font-style: italic;">At KMEC, we aim to complement
the work being done in schools so that students can find success there
too.<br>
There is a definite need and our centres help to fulfil that need.</span>"
- Founder, Kip McGrath</h3>
<p>Based in Amanzimtoti, South Africa's head office, co-ordinates
the administration of over 60 Kip McGrath Centres around South Africa.
This family of Franchisees shares a passion to help children achieve
their full potential. Offering tutoring to children from pre-school
through to Grade 12 in Reading, Spelling, Comprehension, English and
Maths, our tutoring centres in South Africa can be found in both
Metropolitan and Regional locations. Look for your closest centre using
our centre locator.</p>
<p>While the primary focus is to improve or extend a child's
learning outcomes, the real value in attending a Kip McGrath Education
Centre are the tutors who tutor at each centre. For our tutors,
teaching is not a job it is a vocation. Nothing inspires a Kip teacher
more than a smile from a child who finally "gets it"! Watching a child
suddenly start to enjoy learning and developing a confidence in their
abilities, naturally translates into better results at school.</p>
<p>Kip McGrath Education Centres deliver a curriculum that has
proven itself. Each child is assessed and a programme is written for
that child based on their individual needs. So if you are looking for
an experience that will improve your child's confidence, encourage them
to enjoy learning and help them improve or extend their literacy and
numeracy, contact your local Kip McGrath Education Centre today.</p>
<p>At our Kip McGrath Education Centres we offer <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">face-to-face tutoring</span>
to children from Grade R through to Grade 12.</p>
