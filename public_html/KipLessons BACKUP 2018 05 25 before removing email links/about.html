                     <p>
                        The first Kip McGrath Education Centre opened its doors in Newcastle, NSW, 40 years ago with the founding principle that "any child can learn if they are taught properly". Founded by school tutors Kip and Dug McGrath, that first tutoring centre has grown since then into a global franchise network of over 500 tutoring centres owned and operated by qualified and experienced tutors, with a common motivation &#8211; a passion for teaching.

                        <li>We believe that all children can succeed if given the right support.</li>

                        While the primary focus is to improve or extend a child's learning outcomes, the real value in attending a Kip McGrath Education Centre is the tutors at each centre. For our tutors, teaching is not a job, it is a vocation. Nothing inspires a Kip teacher more than a smile from a child who finally "gets it"! Watching a child suddenly start to enjoy learning and developing confidence in their abilities, naturally translates into better results at school.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Kip McGrath Education Centres deliver a curriculum that has proven itself. Each child is assessed and a programme is written for that child based on their individual needs. So if you are looking for an experience that will improve your child's confidence, encourage them to enjoy learning and help them improve or extend their literacy and numeracy, contact your local Kip McGrath Education Centre today.

                        All children are given a FREE initial assessment to identify areas where learning needs to be concentrated. An individual learning programme is then tailored for your child based on the assessment results. While all centres provide extra lessons for Maths, Afrikaans and English, not all centres offer all modules or additional subjects, so please confirm with your local Kip McGrath centre.
