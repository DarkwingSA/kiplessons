                        Kip has really brought out the best in my children, like self-discipline. <em>&#8211; Mr Govender, parent at Kip McGrath Umhlanga</em>

                     <blockquote>
                        My son is ADHD, and almost failed last year, but due to assistance from Kip he is now achieving As. He was taught techniques in managing his skills. <em>&#8211; Mr Baker, parent at Kip McGrath Fourways</em>
                     </blockquote>
                     <blockquote>
                        My 6-year old son counts down the sleeps until his Kip class on Tuesday afternoons. Seriously! When I enrolled Tyson for his first class during Grade R last year, it wasn't because he was struggling to keep up, or because he showed signs of child genius. It was because I wanted him to learn that learning could actually be FUN &#8211; and Tracy had convinced me that her classes would be just that. Kip McGrath Umhlanga has not disappointed me, nor my son! In my opinion, the most important thing for our children to take with them to school is excitement about learning. If a child is academically brilliant but does not enjoy learning, it follows that he will not achieve his best. If a child is average, but enjoys his learning, then chances are that he will do the best that he can possibly do. And that's what I want for my child. Kip teaches the kids that learning can be FUN, not a chore. They play games (I've seen them kick the world globe around the classroom), they have fun and they learn. The teachers at Kip McGrath, with Tracy at the helm, are giving my son the best start that he could possibly need for his future. Oh, and they also have great stickers for the kids &#8211; 24 of which are proudly displayed on Tyson's Kip homework folder! <em>&#8211; Mrs Andrews, parent at Kip McGrath Umhlanga</em>

                        Hi! Just a quick note to let you know that Jennifer went from failing Afrikaans in term two to achieving 76&#37;! Kip McGrath has been absolutely key in her achieving these results and we would like to extend a huge thank you to the team for their efforts and patience with her. It is so good to see her enjoying Afrikaans and having the confidence to participate in class! Her teacher at school is amazed at the results as well! Thank you so much! <em>&#8211; Sarah, parent at Kip McGrath Fourways</em>

                     <blockquote>
                        If you want to be like Thendu, go to Kip McGrath. <em>&#8211; Teacher to her class of Grade 7 children (Thendu was an average pupil before starting at Kip McGrath Sandton three years ago. He is now a very confident young man and the Dux Scholar at his school. He was recently offered a scholarship at a leading private school)</em>

                     <blockquote>
                        When I first brought my daughter Zakithi I had tried everything and I was honestly starting to believe she should go to a special school. Thank you so much for everything, I'm seeing great change in her school work. Words cannot express how I'm feeling right now. <em>&#8211; Thando Sangweni, parent at Kip McGrath Queensburgh</em>
                     </blockquote>
                     <blockquote>
                        Tyreece has always detested mathematics. Starting at Kip McGrath has given him more confidence and understanding of the various concepts to such a degree where he says that he even helps some of the kids at school. I just wish that I had brought him to Kip McGrath a lot sooner. <em>&#8211; Parent at Kip McGrath Queensburgh</em>
                     </blockquote>
                     <blockquote>
                        Kip McGrath has helped my son gain confidence and a zeal to love the subject mathematics. Since starting at Kip McGrath in 2013, he had been obtaining 50&#37; in Math and now 2016, gained 81&#37;. We are so grateful and recommend Kip McGrath. Thank you for your excellent work. <em>&#8211; Parent at Kip McGrath Queensburgh</em>
                     </blockquote>
                     <blockquote>
                        Kip is a wonderful place of learning. Family run, love-filled education. The best investment for your child's bright future. <em>&#8211; Parent at Kip McGrath Queensburgh</em>
                     </blockquote>
                     <blockquote>
                        I would definitely recommend Kip McGrath to other parents. I have seen a major difference in Amir's work. He now loves to learn and can't wait for his lessons at Kip McGrath. Thank you! <em>&#8211; Parent at Kip McGrath Queensburgh</em>

                        All children are given a FREE initial assessment to identify areas where learning needs to be concentrated. An individual learning programme is then tailored for your child based on the assessment results. While all centres provide extra lessons for maths, Afrikaans and English, not all centres offer all modules or additional subjects, so please confirm with your local Kip McGrath centre.
